# Audio File Fix - Summary

## Problem Fixed âœ…

### **Issue**: "Windows Media Player cannot play the file"
- **Root Cause**: The application was creating text files with `.wav` extensions instead of actual audio files
- **Error**: Downloaded files contained text like "placeholder audio content" instead of audio data

### **Solution**: Create Proper WAV Files
- **Added method**: `_create_placeholder_wav()` that generates real WAV files
- **Audio format**: 44.1 kHz, 16-bit, mono, 5-second duration
- **Content**: Simple 440 Hz sine wave tone (soft volume)

## Technical Details

### Before Fix:
```python
# This created a TEXT file with .wav extension
audio_file.write_text("placeholder audio content")
```

### After Fix:
```python
# This creates a REAL WAV file with audio data
self._create_placeholder_wav(audio_file)
```

### WAV File Specifications:
- **Sample Rate**: 44,100 Hz (CD quality)
